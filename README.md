# Discovery EA

## Description
Discovery EA is an advanced automated Forex trading solution developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It utilizes a channel system strategy to identify potential trading opportunities.

The expert advisor (EA) is designed to work on the MetaTrader 5 platform. It allows the user to define input parameters such as the higher timeframe for trade direction and the lower timeframe for trade initiation. The EA then calculates the upper and lower channel levels based on these parameters.

The EA continuously monitors the price data and checks if both the higher and lower timeframe signals align with the defined channel levels. If the conditions are met, the EA opens a buy trade if the upper channel value is above the upper channel level, or a sell trade if the lower channel value is below the lower channel level.
